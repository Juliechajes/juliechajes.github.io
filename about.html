        <p>
          I am an academic researcher, author, and speaker with more than a
          decade's experience in the global higher education industry. I am
          skilled in research, analysis, teaching, project management, and all
          forms of written and oral communication.
        </p>

        <p>
          I have conducted research in intellectual and cultural history,
          religious studies, and literature. I specialise in the non-mainstream
          religious currents of nineteenth-century Britain and America (with
          ocassional visits to India).

    <h2>Coding</h2>
    <p>
      I recently took a short course in web development at
      <a href="https://www.itc.tech/about-us/" target="_blank"
        >Israel Tech Challenge</a
      >
      with a view to adding a few tech skills to my resume. I was surprised to
      discover how much I enjoy coding. Having recently experienced some
      significant life challenges, I have found coding to be a positive and even
      therapeutic activity that brings a steep learning curve and valuable sense
      of achievement in a completely new area. I enjoy the creativity,
      problem-solving, and detail orientation, as well as the fact that there
      are multiple solutions to any given problem.

    <h2>In my spare time...</h2>
    <p>
      ...I love reading, listening to podcasts, learning Japanese, meditating,
      and exercising.
